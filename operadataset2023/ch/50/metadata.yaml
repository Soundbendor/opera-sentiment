lyric:
  english: Since you wrote about your intention to visit the countryside, Chaoyanggou has been bustling with activity for the past few days. The old secretary has been promoting the idea at large meetings and explaining it at small ones. Erniang has covered the entire wall with red and green slogans. My little sister has been waiting for you at the village entrance several times a day. My mother feels that the nights are particularly long because she can't sleep. My father tells everyone he meets that we are full of hope for the future, because now you are here to help us with scientific research and cultivating improved seeds.
  original: 自从你们写信要下乡 朝阳沟这几天忙了又忙 老支书大会宣传小会讲 二大娘把红绿标语贴满墙 小妹妹一天村头接几趟 我的娘睡不着只嫌夜长 我的爹逢人就说有了希望 搞科研育良种有人帮忙

  translate: 自从你们写信说要下乡，朝阳沟这几天一直忙碌不停。老支书在大会上宣传，小会上讲解；二大娘把红色和绿色的标语贴满了整个墙壁；小妹妹一天在村头接你们好几次；我的母亲因为睡不着觉，觉得夜晚特别漫长；我的父亲一见到人就说我们对未来充满了希望，因为现在有了你们来帮忙搞科研培育良种。
