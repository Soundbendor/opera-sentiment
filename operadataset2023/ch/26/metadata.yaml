lyric:
  english: There are countless cousins in our family, and they usually won't visit unless there's something important. Although they are relatives, they don't often keep in touch, but they are closer than those relatives who come and go frequently. Both Dad and Grandma affectionately call them family, and I can guess some of the mystery behind it. They are the same as Dad, all possessing a sincere and kind heart.
  original: 我家的表叔数不清 没有大事不登门 虽说是亲眷不相认 可他比亲眷还要亲 爹爹和奶奶齐声唤亲人 这里的奥妙我也能猜出几分 他们和爹爹都一样 都有一颗红亮的心

  translate: 我们家的表叔们多得数不清，除非有重要的事情否则不会上门。虽然说是亲戚关系但并不常常相互走动，但他们却比那些常来常往的亲戚还要亲近。爹爹和奶奶都亲切地称呼他们为亲人，其中的奥妙我也能猜出几分。他们和爹爹都一样，都拥有一颗赤诚善良的心。
