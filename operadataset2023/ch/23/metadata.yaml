lyric:
  english: His appearance is dirty, his clothes are slovenly and ragged, making people frightened when they see him. However, I don't think he is a faithless person. After all, as the saying goes, "A couple who sleep together for one night will remain grateful for each other for hundreds of nights." He might still miss the love by his bedside and doesn't want to mention the current situation. He is like vegetables out of the garden, flowers fallen from the tree. I have carefully considered it, but I don't know what to do. Ah, as we speak, it's already the beginning of the first watch. I'll just close the door and go inside first. Alas, Mrs. Cui, how bitter and miserable your fate is! As a person with a miserable fate, I suffer from heaven's punishment. I'd rather consider this pair of eyes as blind.
  original: 只是形龌龊 身邋遢 衣衫褴褛 把人唬杀 且住 我想他也不是负心的人 又道一夜夫妻百夜恩哩 毕竟还想枕边情 不说眼前话 好似出园菜 做了落树花 我细寻思 教我如何价 呀 说话之间 又早初更时分 我且闭门进去罢 咳 崔氏吓崔氏 你好命苦 阿呀你好命薄吓 奴薄命 天折罚 一双眼睛呀啐只当瞎

  translate: 只是他形貌龌龊，衣着邋遢，衣衫褴褛，让人看了吓一跳。不过，我想他也不是一个负心的人，毕竟俗话说“一夜夫妻百夜恩”，他可能还念着枕边之情，不愿提及眼前之事。他就像出园的菜，成了落树的花，我仔细思量，却不知该如何是好。呀，说话间已是初更时分，我还是先关门进去吧。咳，崔氏啊崔氏，你的命好苦啊，你的命好薄啊！我薄命之人，遭受天罚，这一双眼睛啊，干脆当作瞎了算了。
