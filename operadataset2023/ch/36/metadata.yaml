lyric:
  english: Life is indeed unpredictable, never expecting reunions to occur today. Looking back, those moments of prosperity seem as fleeting as a dream. My remaining life, like a thread of hope, is entrusted to the tumultuous waves. Though the path ahead may be obscure with possibilities, I no longer experience extreme joy or sorrow. Instead, I hope that my inner goodness will bloom like a flower, for which I am proud. Good deeds leading to good fruits, this is the best reward. I feel guilty for the small token of affection I once gave you.
  original: 这才是人生难预料 不想团圆在今朝 回首繁华如梦渺 残生一线付惊涛 柳暗花明休啼笑 善果心花可自豪 种福得福如此报 愧我当初赠木桃

  translate: 这才是人生难以预料，没想到团圆会发生在今天。回首过去，那些繁华就像梦境一样飘渺，我的余生就像一线生机，交付给了惊涛骇浪。尽管前路柳暗花明，我已不再悲喜交加，只愿内心的善良如花朵般绽放，为此我感到自豪。种下善因得到善果，这就是最好的回报，我愧疚于当初赠予你的那一点微薄情意
