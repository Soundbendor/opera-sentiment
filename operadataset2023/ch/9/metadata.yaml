lyric:
  english: As I arrived at the bustling intersection, I would like to tell you all the story from the beginning. I am neither a robber nor a thief, nor am I a bad person sneaking into the city. I got into a fight with Yang Lin, and that's why I was exiled to Dengzhou. I cannot bear to part with my master's kindness, nor can I leave behind the officers and my fellow comrades. I am truly reluctant to bid farewell to my neighbors and good friends. What hurts the most is the thought of my mother, whose hair has turned white. As a mother and son, our hearts are connected. She worries whenever I travel far away. It's hard for me to kneel before her and express my gratitude, while she sheds tears whenever she thinks of me. As I see the red sun setting behind the western mountains, I call out to the escort and ask to find a place to rest.

  translate: 我走到了这繁华的大街上，各位来宾朋友请听我从头说起：我既不是响马也不是贼寇，更不是歹人偷偷进了城。我和杨林发生了争斗，因此被发配到登洲。我舍不得老爷的恩情，舍不得那些衙役和众班头，也舍不得街坊四邻和我的好朋友们。我更是舍不得我那头发已经花白的母亲。娘生了我，我们母子连心，我远行千里母亲总是担忧。我想念母亲却难以向她叩首行礼，而母亲思念我时则泪水直流。眼看着红日已经西沉，我喊一声解差，我们去投宿吧。
