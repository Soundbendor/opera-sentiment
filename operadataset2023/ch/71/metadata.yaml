lyric:
  english: As soon as I, Hongniang, utter the word "please," he dreams of becoming a groom today. Madame's reputation surpasses even the command of a general, and is comparable to the imperial edict of a monarch, leaving no room for hesitation or delay. I have always been stern-hearted, but upon seeing him today, I cannot help but feel sympathy for him.
  original: 我红娘将说是一声请 他就想今日做新人 夫人名亚赛过将军令 又好比君命诏不俟驾而行 我从来是心硬 今日一见也同情
  phonetic: ''
  translate: 我红娘只要说一声"请"，他就想今天就能成为新郎。夫人的名声，亚赛过将军的命令，又好比君王的诏书，不容许有片刻的犹豫和等待。我一向是心肠硬的，但今天一见他，也忍不住同情他。
