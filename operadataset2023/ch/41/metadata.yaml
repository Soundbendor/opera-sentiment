lyric:
  english: I was originally a man who lived a leisurely life in Wolonggang, proficient in the arts of Yin and Yang, and knowledgeable in both ancient and modern affairs. When the late emperor was in Nanyang, he invited me personally three times, and it was because of this that I established the foundation for the Han Dynasty, achieving the situation of the Three Kingdoms standing in equal power. I was appointed as the Marquis of Wuxiang and took control of the general's seal. I led battles to the east and west, north and south, defending the stability of the country. King Wen of Zhou found Jiang Shang, and the Zhou Dynasty flourished because of him. But how dare I, Zhuge Liang of the Han Dynasty, compare myself to those predecessors? When I have nothing to do in my leisure time, I play a tune on the qin on the enemy tower. However, unfortunately, I lack a soulmate who can understand the depths of my heart.
  original: 我本是卧龙岗散淡的人 凭阴阳如反掌博古通今 先帝爷下南阳御驾三请 算就了汉家的业鼎足三分 官封到武乡侯执掌帅印 东西战南北剿保定乾坤 周文王访姜尚周室大振 汉诸葛怎比得前辈的先生 闲无事在敌楼我亮一亮琴音 我面前缺少个知音的人

  translate: 我原本是一个在卧龙岗过着悠闲生活的人，精通阴阳之术，博古通今。先帝在南阳时，三次亲自来邀请我，我因此为汉朝立下了基业，实现了三国鼎立的局面。我被封为武乡侯，执掌帅印，东征西战，南征北剿，保卫了国家的安定。周文王访得姜尚，周室因此大振，但我这个汉朝的诸葛亮，怎么敢与那些前辈相提并论呢？闲暇无事时，我在敌楼上弹奏一曲琴音，但遗憾的是，我面前缺少一个能懂我心声的知音。
