lyric:
  english: Once upon a time, there were three great wise men, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. They pledged brotherhood in the Peach Garden. The brothers once lost each other in Xuzhou, but later reunited in the Ancient City. Guan Yu called out to Zhang Fei on horseback, while Zhang Fei on the city wall was so enraged that his hair stood on end. Then, they heard shouts in their ears, revealing that Cai Yang's troops had arrived at the edge of the Ancient City. On the city wall, Zhang Fei cheered Guan Yu on, beating three rounds of drums. Ten flags fluttered in the wind, exhibiting dignity and solemnity. After the first round of drums, Guan Yu drew his sword and mounted his finely carved saddle. After the second round, he looked refreshed, and his horse became lively. By the end of the third round, Cai Yang's head had fallen before the horse. Firstly, it was Cai Yang's fate to die, and secondly, it was because these three brothers had reunited. Zhang Fei advised Guan Yu not to return to Chang'an and instead to spend a few years of leisure in Shatuo.
  original: 昔日有个三大贤 刘关张结义在桃园 弟兄们徐州曾失散 古城相逢又团圆 关二爷马上呼三弟 张翼德在城楼怒发冲冠 耳边厢又听人呐喊 老蔡阳的人马来到了古城边 城楼上助你三通鼓 十面旌旗壮壮威严 哗喇喇打罢了头通鼓 关二爷提刀跨雕鞍 哗喇喇打罢了二通鼓 人有精神马又欢 哗喇喇打罢了三通鼓 蔡阳的人头落在马前 一来是老儿命该丧 二来弟兄得团圆 贤弟休回长安转 就在这沙陀过几年 落得个清闲

  translate: 从前有三位大贤人，刘备、关羽和张飞，他们在桃园结为了兄弟。兄弟们在徐州曾经失散，但后来在古城重逢并再次团聚。关羽在马上呼唤张飞，而张飞在城楼上愤怒得头发都竖起来了。这时，他们耳边又传来了呐喊声，原来蔡阳的人马已经来到了古城的边缘。在城楼上，张飞为关羽助威，敲响了三通鼓，十面旌旗在风中飘扬，显得威严而庄重。第一通鼓声响起后，关羽提起刀，跨上雕鞍马；第二通鼓声后，人变得精神焕发，马也欢快起来；第三通鼓声结束后，蔡阳的人头已经落在了马前。这首先是蔡阳命中注定该死，其次也是因为这三位兄弟得以团聚。张飞劝关羽不要回长安，就在沙陀这个地方过上几年清闲的日子。
