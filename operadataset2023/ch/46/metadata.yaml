lyric:
  english: I was originally a poor scholar with a strong personality, who had unintentionally offended the mansion of the venerable teacher. Thinking about my wife and I sharing both the sweetness and bitterness of life, yet our fate was full of twists and turns, and our mandarin duck couple was separated by the waves of fate. I never got drunk from drinking in the past, but today this wine has made me intoxicated.
  original: 我本是一穷儒太烈性 冒犯了老太师府门庭 念卑人结发糟糠多薄命 浪打鸳鸯两离分 我往日饮酒酒不醉 到今日饮酒酒醉人
  phonetic: ''
  translate: 我本来就是一个性格刚烈的贫穷书生，不小心冒犯了老太师的府邸。想到我妻子与我同甘共苦，命运多舛，我们这对鸳鸯却被命运的风浪打得分离。我往日喝酒从不会醉，但今天这酒却让我沉醉。
