lyric:
  english: Yang Silang's heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. He found it difficult to part with his elderly mother, the six talented and virtuous brothers, and even more so, his two virtuous sisters who were yet to be married. He was truly unable to separate from his wife who had shared the same pillow with him. Well, Yang Silang made up his mind to change his intention, and hurried back to the foreign camp without a moment's delay. With a hard heart, he pushed his family out of his heart's door.
  original: 杨四郎心中似刀裁 舍不得老娘年高迈 舍不得六贤弟将英才 舍不得二贤妹未出闺门外 实难舍结发的夫妻两分开 罢 杨四郎把心肠改 急回番营莫迟挨 狠心肠一家人推帐外

  translate: 杨四郎心中如刀割，难以割舍年迈的母亲，也舍不得才华横溢的六位贤弟，更舍不得两位尚未出嫁的贤妹。他实在难以与结发的妻子分开。罢了，杨四郎决心改变心意，急忙赶回番营，不敢有片刻的耽误。他狠下心来，将家人都推到了心门之外。
