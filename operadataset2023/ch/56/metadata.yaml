lyric:
  english: In the palace, I received the emperor's imperial decree to go and advise my noble son-in-law, the royal consort. I advised you, my son-in-law, not to act impulsively, as you are still young. As the queen mother, I cherish my daughter, but I also equally cherish you, my son-in-law. My daughter's failure to come and greet on the occasion of the birthday celebration was her disrespect, but you should not have, in a drunken rage, stormed into the palace and loudly scolded.
  original: 在宫院我领了万岁旨意 上前去劝一劝驸马爱婿 劝驸马你休发少年的脾气 国母我爱女儿更疼女婿 我女儿不拜寿是她无礼 你不该吃酒带醉怒气冲冲 进得宫去大骂一气

  translate: 在皇宫里，我接到了皇帝的旨意，前去劝解我那尊贵的驸马女婿。我劝驸马你，不要意气用事，毕竟你还年轻。作为国母，我疼爱我的女儿，但也同样疼爱你这位女婿。我女儿没有来拜寿，是她的失礼之处，但你不该在喝了酒后，怒气冲冲地冲进皇宫，大声斥责。
