lyric:
  english: Living by the Pingshui River in Anyuan, our three generations have been mining coal, working like horses and oxen. Despite sweating our guts out, we still struggled to make ends meet, living a hellish life unable to distinguish between winter, summer, spring, and autumn. When we staged a strike, my father and brothers angrily denounced the foreman and bravely fought them, but their aspirations were not fulfilled, and they were shot dead, with their blood spilling all over the wilderness. That vicious mine owner, whose heart was even blacker than charcoal, took another evil action and burned my mother, sister, and brother alive with a single fire. The remains of our family members were difficult to find. During the tumultuous autumn harvest uprising, a bright light illuminated my heart, and I realized that to rise up, we must have guns in our hands. I joined the army and the Communist Party, determined to fight for the freedom of the poor people in the world. Workers and peasants, we walk together on the path of revolution, vowing not to rest until those wolves are eliminated.
  original: 家住安源萍水头 三代挖煤做马牛 汗水流尽难糊口 地狱里度岁月 不识冬夏与春秋 闹罢工 我父兄怒斥工头 英勇搏斗 壮志未酬 遭枪杀 血溅荒丘 那贼矿主心比炭黑又下毒手 一把火烧死了我亲娘弟妹 一家数口尸骨难收 秋收暴动风雷骤 明灯照亮 明灯照亮我心头才懂得翻身必须枪在手 参军 入党 要为那天下的穷人争自由 工友和农友 一条革命路上走 不灭豺狼誓不休 不灭豺狼誓不休

  translate: 家住安源萍水边，我们祖孙三代都在挖煤，如同马牛一般劳作。尽管汗水流尽，却依然难以糊口，过着如地狱般的生活，分不清冬夏和春秋。当我们举行罢工时，我的父兄愤怒地斥责工头，英勇地与他们搏斗，但壮志未酬，却遭到了枪杀，鲜血溅满了荒野。那个恶毒的矿主心比炭黑还要狠，他又下了毒手，用一把火烧死了我的母亲、妹妹和弟弟，我们一家几口人的尸骨都难以找到。在秋收暴动的风雷中，明灯照亮了我的心头，我才明白，要想翻身，就必须有枪在手。我参军、入党，要为天下的穷人争取自由。工人和农民，我们一同走在革命的道路上，不消灭那些豺狼，我们誓不罢休。
