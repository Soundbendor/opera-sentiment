lyric:
  english: I advise you not to utter the word "kill" lightly. Let me explain this matter to you from the beginning. Liu Bei is actually a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan, the great-grandson of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, whose bloodline has been passed down to this day. He has a younger brother, Guan Yu, the Marquis of Hanshou Pavilion, who wields the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, feared by both gods and ghosts. He slew Yan Liang at the Battle of Baima Slope, defeated Wen Chou at Yanjin, and decapitated Cai Yang at the Ancient City.His third younger brother, Zhang Fei, is extremely powerful. His spear, known as the Zhangba Snake Spear, often strikes straight for the enemy's throat. His fury was so great when he whipped the postman Du You that it seemed to pierce the heavens. At the Tiger Fort, he faced off with Lu Bu, and before the Dangyang Bridge, he roared so loudly that it actually caused the bridge to break and the river to flow backwards. His fourth younger brother, Zhao Yun, is a general from Changshan, a heroic figure renowned throughout the Nine Provinces. He rescued A Dou at the Changban Slope and slaughtered the Cao Wei troops, leaving them all in awe. Aren't these brave generals all invincible? Add to that the fact that Zhuge Liang plans strategies for them. Perhaps killing Liu Bei is not significant, but how could his brothers let it go once they find out? If they lead their troops to fight, Cao Cao will reap the benefits without lifting a finger. Therefore, I have decided to turn and report to the Empress Dowager, letting the situation unfold naturally and arranging for Liu Bei to form an alliance with Sun Quan through marriage.

  translate: 我劝你不要轻易说出“杀”这个字，让我从头开始为你解释这件事。刘备，他其实是中山靖王的后代，是汉景帝的玄孙，血脉流传至今。他有一个二弟，是汉寿亭侯关羽，他手持青龙偃月刀，使得神鬼都畏惧。他在白马坡斩杀了颜良，在延津诛杀了文丑，还在古城斩下了老蔡阳的头颅。他的三弟张飞，威猛无比，他的丈八蛇矛常常直取敌人咽喉。他在鞭打都邮时，气势冲天。在虎牢关前，他与吕布交战，而在当阳桥前，他一声怒吼，竟然使得桥梁断裂，河水倒流。他的四弟赵云，是常山的将领，他是盖世的英雄，威名远播九州。他在长坂坡救下了阿斗，杀得曹兵人人畏惧。这些虎将，哪一个不是英勇无敌？再加上有诸葛亮为他们出谋划策。你杀刘备或许不重要，但他的兄弟们知道了这件事，怎么可能罢休？如果他们领兵来争斗，曹操就能坐收渔翁之利。因此，我决定转身去奏报太后，我们可以顺水推舟，让刘备与孙权结为亲家。
